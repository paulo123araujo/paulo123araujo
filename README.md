ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m [Paulo AraÃºjo](@paulo123araujo)
I'm fullstack developer, but I like most backend.

My main skills are:
- PHP
- Javascript
- Docker
- Software Architecture

I am learning about:
- DDD (Domain-Driven Design)
- Hexagonal, clean, onion architecture

The tecnological world is really amazing, there are a lot of freedom to be creatively, to apply what we learn in books, articles, courses in the real world.
